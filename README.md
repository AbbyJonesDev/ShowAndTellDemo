# Show & Tell Demo

Week 1 Project for OCS: Highlander

## Project Goals:
- Build a static website about a topic of personal interest using HTML and CSS
- Include multiple pages linked together
- Add images (audio and video may also be added if students choose)
- Practice writing clean, accurate code

This version of the site will be mobile-first.  In fact, it will be mobile only.  Later in the course, we will build out the content into a responsive design.

## Process:
- [Planning Phase](https://github.com/AbbyJonesDev/ShowAndTellDemo/tree/master/process_docs)
- [Skeleton Files]()
