        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
          The djembe originated in western Africa during the Mali empire.  The first djembes were created by blacksmiths.  These goblet-shaped hand drums had shells made of hard wood with a goatskin head and ropes for tuning the instrument.  The name "djembe" comes from phrases that translate to "everyone together" or "everyone gather in peace."  It was often used in celebrations and ceremonies such as marriages, baptisms, and circumcisions.

          Traditional djembe music was closely tied to village life.  Specific rhythms were played for specific events or groups people.  Groups of drummers could play the same song for hours, dynamically improvising as the villagers joined in singing and dancing.

          In the 1950's, national performing groups were created to share African culture with the world.  The incredible power and expressiveness of the djembe caught people's attention, and it has become one of the most popular hand drums in the world.  Artists including Paul Simon and Jason Mraz have incorporated the djembe into albums and live performances.  Music stores across the country stock djembes and sponsor drum circles.  Djembes are also found in classrooms and used by music therapists.

          The popularity of the djembe has carried it far from its African roots.  Brands like Remo and Toca pump out drums made of synthetic materials and tuned with hex keys rather than rope.  These drums trade traditional authenticity for convenience; the synthetic materials are less subject to temperature variations and humidity, and the heads can be changed more easily. Some of these drums still retain a nod to their roots, such as the <a href="http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/kente/about.htm">kente cloth</a> patterned drum offered by <a href="http://www.remo.com/portal/products/6/28/175/dj_kt.html?type=Kintekloth">Remo</a>.

          Western artists have also adapted the djembe to Western rhythms.  The versatile drum is powerful in any style, and it never fails to draw people together.

          Those interested in learning the traditional African rhythms can find excellent videos and tutorials on YouTube.  Better yet, groups like Omaha's <a href="http://africancultureconnection.org/">African Culture Connection</a> provide an up-close-and-personal opportunity to experience the richness of African drumming and dancing as an audience member or even as a participant.
